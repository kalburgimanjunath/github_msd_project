## Github Collaboration Project, Modeling Social Data 2017

Using data from GitHub, our group is interested in exploring patterns in users and the projects they work on. Specifically, we are interested in a few different features of our users, including activity, followers, background such as college education and gender, and how these variables impact the popularity and types of projects that they work on. Other possible avenues of investigation include exploring how major public events impact collaboration on GitHub and how features of bug fix comments impact their likelihood of being resolved. We hope to refine our ideas in the coming days when we more closely see what data is available to us.
